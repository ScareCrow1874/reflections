3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: 
pros: manually commit guarantees logical change in profile
cons: user error, possibly unsaved files

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
